                <li>
                    An entrant must not make more than 25 Sports Match Wagers per 24 hour period. Once you have reached
                    the maximum number of Sports Match Wagers for a day, you will be prevented and prohibited from
                    making further Sports Match Wagers in the Contest for the day. Any Sports Match Wagers in excess of
                    the maximum will be void.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your Sports Match Wager is successful, you will be awarded with Tokens in the amount which
                    corresponds with the terms of your wager.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your Sports Match Wager is unsuccessful, the amount of Tokens you wagered will be deducted from
                    your Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a Sports Match is postponed or cancelled, any Sports Match Wagers concerning such postponed or
                    cancelled Sports Match will be voided and the amount of the Wager will be returned to the user's
                    account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Entrants are removed from a Contest and no longer eligible to win that Contest's prize if they have
                    lost or otherwise exhausted all of their Tokens.

                <li>
                    Contest entrants are limited to one Account per Contest. Use of multiple Accounts to enter the same
                    Contest will result in disqualification from the Contest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Sports Match Wager will be deemed received by the Sponsor only when the Sponsor's computer system
                    record receipt of the Sports Match Wager. An entrant's evidence of submitting a Sports Match Wager

            <ul class="decimal-list">
                <li>
                    The potential winner of a Contest is the entrant with the highest profit at the conclusion of the
                    Contest Period (the "Selected Entrant"). If entrants have tied for the highest profit at the
                    conclusion of the Contest Period, then each such tied entrant will be declared a potential winner
                    (also a "Selected Entrant").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Odds of winning the Prize depends on:
                    (a) the total number of eligible entries received during the Contest Period;
                    (b) number of Tokens staked; and

                    (each a "Notice") immediately upon the conclusion of the Contest Period. You agree that you will be
                    solely responsible for any costs you incur in connection with Notices you receive. Notice is deemed
                    to have occurred immediately upon sending the email to the Selected Entrant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a Selected Entrant cannot be contacted within two days after the end of the Contest Period, or if
                    a Selected Entrant or winner has been disqualified, his/her entry will be disqualified and the Prize
                    will be split among all other Selected Entrants who have been declared winners, or if there are no other
                    Selected Entrants who have been declared winners, then the eligible entrant with the next highest
                    profit will become the Selected Entrant and the process above will be repeated until such time as
                    contact is made with a Selected Entrant or there are no more eligible entrants.
                </li>
                <li>

            <h3>10. Disputes</h3>
            <ul class="decimal-list">
                <li>
                    By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to binding arbitration, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
                    Act and subject to the terms below, of any and all claims (regardless of the date of accrual of such
                    claim) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Platform. Your agreement covers claims
                    that arose prior to, as well as those that may arise after, the effective date of the Agreement to
                    Arbitrate. You and Company agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the "writing"
                    requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act and further agree that, notwithstanding any other provision
                    of the Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
                    Agreement to Arbitrate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a dispute arises or has arisen between you and Company regarding a claim, you and we agree to
                    alternative dispute resolution. Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means
                    of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of, has arisen
                    out of, or relates to the Platform or these Terms, your decision to enter into these Terms, or any
                    additional matters within the scope of this Agreement to Arbitrate (collectively, "Dispute(s)"),
                    then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of
                    the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on
                    the most recent contact information that you provide us. However, if no such information exists or
                    if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us
                    must be sent to:
                    <ul class="alpha-list">
                        <li>Vegas Lit, LLC Attn: CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we and you
                    will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, although neither party is
                    required to resolve such Dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, deems unsatisfactory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we cannot resolve a Dispute within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice, then either you or
                    we may elect to submit the Dispute to mandatory, binding arbitration as hereinafter described.
                    WITH ARBITRATION, (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION
                    OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION
                    OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Further, you and Company agree that, Disputes resolved in arbitration will be arbitrated only on an
                    individual basis and NOT A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN COMPANY AND YOU will
                    not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any OTHER PARTY'S
                    claim or controversy. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any
                    arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the
                    arbitration to Disputes between you and Company, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to
                    arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to
                    Section 12 below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Should either you or Company elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the
                    arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
                    American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), except that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a
                    class or representative action. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $5,000,000, then
                    the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge
                    or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the
                    substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance
                    with the AAA's then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
                    (however then-titled). If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $5,000,000, then the
                    arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected
                    by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed
                    members or by the AAA in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules (however
                    then-titled). The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and
                    the provisions of these Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts
                    based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or
                    unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then
                    either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
                    Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration
                    administration service to which you and a legal officer of Company consent in writing, except, as
                    noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The
                    substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $5,000,000 threshold for the
                    number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such
                    arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service. You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules,
                    and fee information as follows:
                    <ul class="alpha-list">
                        <li>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or www.adr.org</li>
                        <li>JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or www.jamsadr.com</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an
                    attorney or other advocate of their choosing. The parties may agree to conduct the arbitration
                    proceedings electronically (including via telephone or video conference) or purely based on written
                    submissions. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the
                    "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at
                    the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and
                    arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including
                    any rules regarding hardship), but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Company to pay
                    a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be
                    enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by
                    paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Company
                    will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will
                    be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator's decision must consist
                    of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a
                    statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) are
                    based. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party attorneys' fees and costs in its discretion
                    and consistent with applicable law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek, from the court specified in Section 12 or any
                    other court that otherwise possesses jurisdiction over the parties, temporary injunctive relief to
                    preserve the status quo or to prevent imminent or stop ongoing harm, until an arbitrator can be
                    empaneled and can determine whether to continue, modify or terminate that relief. Actions to compel
                    arbitration pursuant to this Agreement to Arbitrate or to enforce an arbitral award rendered
                    pursuant thereto may be brought in any court specified in Section 12 or that otherwise possesses
                    jurisdiction over the parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may opt out of this arbitration provision only by sending written notice via U.S. Mail, or by
                    any
                    nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.), to:

                        <li>
                            You must send such notice within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of these Terms of
                            Service. You must sign and date the notice, and include in it your name, address, and a clear
                            statement that you do not wish to resolve Disputes with Company through arbitration. If you
                            do not follow this procedure by your thirty (30) day deadline to do so, then you and Company
                            shall both be bound by the terms of this arbitration provision.
                        </li>

                    Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other terms to the contrary, IN THE EVENT A DISPUTE ARISES OR
                    HAS ARISEN BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY THAT IS NOT ARBITRATED FOR ANY REASON, YOU AGREE THAT SUCH DISPUTE
                    will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.
                </li>
