                        Sites in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by
                        saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular website.
                        Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you
                        receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without

                Right to Delete<br>
                You have the right to request that VegasLit delete the personal information that we collected from you
                and retain, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request

            <p>
                Requests to Know and Delete<br>
                To exercise your right to know and right to delete described above, please submit a verifiable consumer
                request to us using our Privacy Rights Request form found at the end of this policy or you can e-mail us
                at info@vegaslit.com.<br>
                Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                related to your personal information. If you wish to submit a verifiable consumer request on behalf of
                another individual, we will also need sufficient information to verify that the individual is the person
                about whom we collected personal information and that you are authorized to submit the request on their
                behalf.<br>
                You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete your data twice within a 12-month
                period. Your request must:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                    collected personal information or are an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                    respond to it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We will need to verify your identity before processing most requests, which may require us to obtain
                additional personal information from you. We will only use the personal information provided in
                connection with a request to review and comply with the request. If you do not provide this information,
                we may not be able to verify or complete your request.<br>
                Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Response Timing and Format<br>
                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If
                we require more time, we will inform you of the reason for the extension.<br>
                Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                requestâ€™s receipt. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal
                information that is readily useable.<br>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
                why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
                In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above.
                California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request information regarding the
                disclosure of their personal information by us to third parties for the third partiesâ€™ direct marketing
                purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. We will provide you with a list of the
                categories of personal information disclosed and a list of the names and addresses of the third parties.
