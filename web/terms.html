                Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver
            </h3>
            <ul class="decimal-list">
                <li>
                    By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to binding arbitration, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and subject to the terms below, of any and all claims (regardless of the date of accrual of such claim) arising out of
                    or in connection with these Terms or the Platform. Your agreement covers claims that arose prior to, as well as those that may arise after, the effective date of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Company agree that we
                    intend that this Section 17 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act and further agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the
                    interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a dispute arises or has arisen between you and Company regarding a claim, you and we agree to alternative dispute resolution. Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute
                    quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of, has arisen out of, or relates to the Platform or these Terms, your decision to enter into these Terms, or any additional matters within the scope of this
                    Agreement to Arbitrate (collectively, "Dispute(s)"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to
                    you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. However, if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this section. Your
                    notice to us must be sent to:
                </li>
                <ul class="alpha-list">
                    <li>Vegas Lit, LLC</li>
                    <li>Attn: CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, although neither party is required to resolve such
                    Dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, deems unsatisfactory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we cannot resolve a Dispute within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice, then either you or we may elect to submit the Dispute to mandatory, binding arbitration as hereinafter described. WITH ARBITRATION, (A)
                    THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Further, you and Company agree that, Disputes resolved in arbitration will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and NOT A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN COMPANY AND YOU will not be consolidated
                    with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any OTHER PARTY’S claim or controversy. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration
                    provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Disputes between you and Company, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in
                    court pursuant to Section 19 below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Should either you or Company elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                    Association ("AAA"), except that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $5,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and
                    determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who
                    will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (however then-titled). If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $5,000,000, then the
                    arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in
                    accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules (however then-titled). The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms, will determine
                    any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then either party can elect
                    to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service to which
                    you and a legal officer of Company consent in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the
                    arbitrator and the $5,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service. You can
                    obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or www.adr.org</li>
                    <li>JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or www.jamsadr.com</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. The parties may agree to conduct the arbitration proceedings electronically
                    (including via telephone or video conference) or purely based on written submissions. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the
                    U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration
                    rules (including any rules regarding hardship), but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Company to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be
                    enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Company will have the right to
                    elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition
                    of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) are based. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party attorneys’ fees and
                    costs in its discretion and consistent with applicable law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek, from the court specified in Section 19 or any other court that otherwise possesses jurisdiction over the parties, temporary injunctive relief to preserve the status
                    quo or to prevent imminent or stop ongoing harm, until an arbitrator can be empaneled and can determine whether to continue, modify or terminate that relief. Actions to compel arbitration pursuant to this Agreement to
                    Arbitrate or to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant thereto may be brought in any court specified in Section 19 or that otherwise possesses jurisdiction over the parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may opt out of this arbitration provision only by sending written notice via U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.), to:

                        You must send such notice within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of these Terms of Service. You must sign and date the notice, and include in it your name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to
                        resolve Disputes with Company through arbitration. If you do not follow this procedure by your thirty (30) day deadline to do so, then you and Company shall both be bound by the terms of this arbitration provision.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other terms to the contrary, IN THE EVENT A DISPUTE ARISES OR HAS ARISEN BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY THAT IS NOT ARBITRATED FOR ANY REASON, YOU AGREE THAT SUCH DISPUTE will be resolved
                    individually, without resort to any form of class action.
